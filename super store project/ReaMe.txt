# Superstore Data Analysis

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze the sales and profitability data of a superstore chain over a specified period to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.


## Tools Used 🧑‍💻💻

### Tableau

##Key Tasks and Analysis:
  1. Data Collection:
   - Gather sales and profit data from the superstore chain's    databases or provided datasets.
   - Ensure data quality and completeness.

  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and identify any initial patterns or trends.
   - Perform summary statistics to get an overview of sales, profit margins, and other relevant metrics.
   - Visualize the data using charts (like bar plots, histograms, etc.) to understand distributions and relationships.

  3. Sales Analysis:
   - Analyze sales trends over time .
   - Identify top-selling products, categories, and regions.
   - Explore seasonality effects on sales.

  4. Profitability Analysis:
   - Calculate profit margins (gross and net) for different products and categories.
   - Identify factors influencing profitability (e.g., pricing strategies, cost management).
   - Compare profitability across different segments (product lines, customer segments).
